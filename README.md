# Rune Labs Frontend Technical Challenge

## To Run:
`cd` to file
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

## Notes:
I did not get to complete "A filter dropdown that allows users to filter products by category." due to time constraints.
I tested a solution by adding the `display: none` style to a card and the card got hidden with the next card taking its place without a blank area. I would have tried to add that style to the card as a simpler CSS solution to not have to implement any heavy js work.
